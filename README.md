# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Novel Quine McCluskey Binary Classifier (QMBC)

## 📌 Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early prediction can help healthcare professionals make faster and more accurate decisions.  

This project introduces a **Novel Quine McCluskey Binary Classifier (QMBC)** — an ensemble machine learning approach that combines multiple classification models to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.

The system applies feature selection, feature extraction, and machine learning techniques to improve prediction accuracy while reducing computational complexity.
